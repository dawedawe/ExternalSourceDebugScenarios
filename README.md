This repository tries to show the current issues C#/F# developers face when debugging in Rider.

In order to enhance the debugging experience it would be beneficial to have something like a whitelisting functionality in Rider, so a developer could list external assemblies/namespaces/packages that the developer wants to be able to step into while all non-listed external assemblies/namespaces/packages would be ignored by the debugger.

If the whitelist consists of assembly names or namespaces or package names is not all that important.
Any approach here would improve the current state.
